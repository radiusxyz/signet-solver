/// Trait for parsing order data from different standards into common structures.
///
/// This trait provides a unified interface for extracting order information
/// from various cross-chain order standards (e.g., EIP-7683, etc.). It enables
/// the solver to work with different order formats through a consistent API,
/// abstracting away the implementation details of each standard.
///
/// # Purpose
///
/// Different cross-chain protocols may represent orders in various formats, but
/// they all share common concepts like inputs (what the user provides) and outputs
/// (what the user receives). This trait standardizes access to these common elements,
/// allowing the solver's core logic to remain agnostic to the specific order standard.
///
/// # Implementation Guidelines
///
/// When implementing this trait for a new order standard:
/// - Ensure all conversions are deterministic and consistent
/// - Handle missing or invalid data gracefully with sensible defaults
/// - Preserve all precision when converting amounts (use U256)
/// - Use InteropAddress for cross-chain compatible addressing
pub trait OrderParsable: Send + Sync {
	/// Extract available inputs from the order data.
	///
	/// Available inputs represent the assets that the order maker is willing
	/// to provide as part of the transaction. Each input includes:
	/// - The user who owns the assets
	/// - The asset details (token address and chain)
	/// - The amount being offered
	/// - Optional lock information if assets are pre-locked
	///
	/// # Returns
	///
	/// A vector of `AvailableInput` instances. May be empty for orders
	/// that don't require specific inputs (e.g., native currency payments).
	///
	/// # Implementation Note
	///
	/// Implementations should handle token address formats appropriate to
	/// their standard and convert them to InteropAddress format.
	fn parse_available_inputs(&self) -> Vec<AvailableInput>;

	/// Extract requested outputs from the order data.
	///
	/// Requested outputs represent the assets that the order maker expects
	/// to receive upon successful execution. Each output includes:
	/// - The receiver address (who gets the assets)
	/// - The asset details (token address and chain)
	/// - The amount to be received
	/// - Optional calldata for contract interactions
	///
	/// # Returns
	///
	/// A vector of `RequestedOutput` instances. May be empty for orders
	/// that don't specify explicit outputs (though this is unusual).
	///
	/// # Implementation Note
	///
	/// Implementations should ensure that recipient addresses are properly
	/// formatted as InteropAddress instances with correct chain IDs.
	fn parse_requested_outputs(&self) -> Vec<RequestedOutput>;

	/// Extract the lock type from the order data, if applicable.
	///
	/// The lock type indicates the mechanism used to secure user funds
	/// during order execution. Common lock types include:
	/// - `"permit2_escrow"` - Uses Permit2 for gasless approvals
	/// - `"eip3009_escrow"` - Uses EIP-3009 for gasless transfers
	/// - `"resource_lock"` - Uses resource locking (e.g., The Compact)
	///
	/// # Returns
	///
	/// - `Some(String)` - The lock type identifier if the order specifies one
	/// - `None` - If the order doesn't specify a lock type or the standard
	///   doesn't support lock types
	///
	/// # Usage
	///
	/// The lock type is primarily used for:
	/// - Determining gas costs (different lock types have different gas requirements)
	/// - Selecting the appropriate settlement contract
	/// - Configuring transaction parameters
	fn parse_lock_type(&self) -> Option<String>;

	/// Get the input oracle address from the order data.
	///
	/// The input oracle is responsible for attesting to order fills on the origin chain.
	/// This oracle validates that the solver has properly filled the order according
	/// to its requirements.
	///
	/// # Returns
	///
	/// The oracle address as a string. For standards that don't use oracles,
	/// this should return a zero address or empty string.
	fn input_oracle(&self) -> String;

	/// Get the origin chain ID where the order originates.
	///
	/// This represents the primary chain where the order was created and
	/// where the input assets are typically located. For single-chain orders,
	/// this is simply the chain of execution. For cross-chain orders, this
	/// is the source chain.
	///
	/// # Returns
	///
	/// The chain ID as a `u64`. Common values include:
	/// - 1 for Ethereum Mainnet
	/// - 137 for Polygon
	/// - 42161 for Arbitrum One
	/// - etc.
	///
	/// # Default Behavior
	///
	/// If the chain ID cannot be determined, implementations should return
	/// a sensible default (typically 1 for Ethereum Mainnet) rather than panic.
	fn origin_chain_id(&self) -> u64;

	/// Get the destination chain IDs where outputs will be delivered.
	///
	/// For cross-chain orders, outputs may be delivered to multiple chains.
	/// This method returns all unique chain IDs where the order expects to
	/// receive assets.
	///
	/// # Returns
	///
	/// A vector of chain IDs. May contain duplicates if multiple outputs
	/// go to the same chain. May be empty if no outputs are specified.
	///
	/// # Usage
	///
	/// This information is used for:
	/// - Calculating cross-chain routing costs
	/// - Determining which bridges/protocols to use
	/// - Estimating gas costs on destination chains
	/// - Validating order feasibility
